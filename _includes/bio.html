                    <p class="text-muted">I am a fifth year student at UC with plans to graduate in May of 2021. I am heavily involved with the UC
                        community and clubs on campus.
                        I am a campus tour guide, so I get to talk to groups of parents and students every week about how much
                        I love being a bearcat, which has inspired me to get a minor in communications. I am also a frequent guest speaker 
                        and give tech talks about UX design and iOS development to tech clubs on campus.

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Computer Science</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">I study computer science at UC and enjoy being involved with the tech community on campus.
                        My favorite event of the year is RevolutionUC, which is UC's student-run hackathon that had +380 attendees last year. 
                        I have helped organized the event for the past four years and this year I will act as Branding Lead and Marketing Advisor.
                        I absolutely love hackathons and the way that it brings the tech community together, which can lead to some truly inspiring and mind-blowing projects.

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Mobile Development</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">I have been developing mobile apps for iOS since 2016. I have a wide range of experience from working 
                        on large beauty retail and grocery apps to consulting and contracting for startups. My technical focuses include CoreBluetooth 
                        and ARKit while incorporating UIKit seamlessly into both. I have developed apps for almost all Apple devices and am eager to 
                        learn more Apple frameworks. I want to continue iOS development throughout my career and am very excited to see where it takes me.
