                    <p class="text-muted">I am a third year student at UC in a five year engineering co-op program. 
                        I love being a bearcat and am involved with a lot of technical and social clubs on campus. 
                        I am a campus tour guide, so I get to talk to groups of parents and students every week about how much
                        I love the university. Also, I am currently the secretary of ACM at UC, and plan to give a tech talk about
                        iOS development later this fall.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">I study computer science at UC and enjoy being involved with the tech community on campus.
                        Last year, I helped plan RevolutionUC, which is UC's student-run hackathon that has +300 attendees. 
                        I am a hackathon enthusiast and try to go to as many as possible during the school year because I love learning
                        about new tech and meeting other Ohio hackers.
