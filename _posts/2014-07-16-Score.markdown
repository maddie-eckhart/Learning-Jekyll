description: Score! is a score-keeping iPhone app that can be used to keep score in Scrabble, poker, card games, or games that keep a numerical scorecard.
p2: Simple interface makes it easy to add players, add and subtract from their score, and reorder players by increasing and decreasing order of their scores. A save feature allows users to exit the game and reload it once the app is closed using core data. Sharing scores through messenger and starting a new game is as easy as a simple click. I will soon be adding a feature that keeps track of dice rolls and displays the average number
