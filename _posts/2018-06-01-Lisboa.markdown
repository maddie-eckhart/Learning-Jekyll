description: In May, I returned to Giant Sparkplug as a UX/UI consultant to lead the visual design of a companion app to a board game. The board game Lisboa is about the reconstruction of Lisbon after an earthquake, tsunami, and three days of fires in 1755.

•	Designed the user interface of an app that acts as a virtual fourth player for the board game Lisboa 
•	Collaborated with the creator to improve the controls and user experience 
•	Provided new designs that tied in the board game’s aesthetic into the app to create a more consistent playing experience
