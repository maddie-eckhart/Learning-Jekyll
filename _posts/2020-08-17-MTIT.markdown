description: MT-IT (pronounced "empty it") is designed to control a specific device (LBE-5A) that is used to drain a wheelchair-bound person’s urine collection leg.  It provides the means to control a solenoid valve contained within the LBE-5A device to enable the person to empty the leg-bag.  The App displays buttons that are used to turn on and off the device’s solenoid as well as an indicator to show the state of the solenoid valve (on or off).  The App also contains a user setting that specifies a time-out in seconds that is used to automatically turn off the solenoid in case the operator forgets to turn it off or the BLE connection is lost.  Provision is included to specify the device’s ID, allowing the app to connect to only a single LBE-5A.  The LBE-5A includes coding that will allow it to bond to only one iPad or iPhone.

p2: This is the first project I've worked on where I was pushed to learn something that I wasn't particularly interested in - Bluetooth. Before MT-IT, I had never created an app that needed to connect to any hardware, so it was definitely a journey to get anything working. I followed a Ray Wenderlich heart monitor tutorial, read some Medium articles, and watched some YouTube videos on how CoreBluetooth worked and how I could use it with my BLE device. It took around 6 months, but I got the device working with the app, saved timeout and device names with CoreData, and used UIKit to make the layouts work on both iPhone and iPad.

p3: I learned so much about CoreBluetooth during the development of this app - the difference between central and peripheral devices, accessing services and characteristics of the device, finding the right peripheral to connect to, and reading and writing to the peripheral. I would definitely consider myself experienced and skilled with CoreBluetooth and I am surprised to say that I am looking forward to playing with it again. Going into this project I didn't think I would enjoy working with hardware, but I actually loved the challenge and it was really rewarding when everything, both hardware and software, worked together. MT-IT is also the first app I have put on the App Store. I am extremely proud of it and while it might not be perfect, I am glad I followed through :)
