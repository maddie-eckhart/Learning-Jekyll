description: This App is designed to control a specific device (LBE-5A) that is used to drain a wheelchair-bound person’s urine collection leg.  It provides the means to control a solenoid valve contained within the LBE-5A device to enable the person to empty the leg-bag.  The App displays buttons that are used to turn on and off the device’s solenoid as well as an indicator to show the state of the solenoid valve (on or off).  The App also contains a user setting that specifies a time-out in seconds that is used to automatically turn off the solenoid in case the operator forgets to turn it off or the BLE connection is lost.  Provision is included to specify the device’s ID, allowing the app to connect to only a single LBE-5A.  The LBE-5A includes coding that will allow it to bond to only one iPad or iPhone.

p2: This the first project I have worked on where I was pushed to learn something that I wasn't particularly interested in - bluetooth.

p3: MT-IT is also the first app I have put on the App Store. I am extremely proud of it and while it might not be perfect, I am glad I followed through and finished it. :)
