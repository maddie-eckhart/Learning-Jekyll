description: Score! is a score-keeping iPhone app that can be used to keep score in Scrabble, poker, card games, or games that keep a numerical scorecard.
p2: Scrabble and Hearts are my favorite games to play, and sometimes finding a piece of paper and a pencil in my house was just impossible. I developed Score! to be an easy app to use with a simple interface that makes it easy to add players, manipulate their score, and reorder players by increasing and decreasing order. Score! is actually the first app that I developed seriously in Xcode, so it was a really important learning experience for me. It was developed in Swift 3 (later updated to Swift 4) and used tables, core data, and OOP. The app also has a save feature which allows users to exit the game and reload it once the app is closed using core data. Sharing scores through messenger and starting a new game is as easy as a simple click. I will soon be adding a feature that keeps track of dice rolls.
