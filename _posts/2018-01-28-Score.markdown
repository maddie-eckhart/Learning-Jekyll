description: Score! is a score-keeping iPhone app that can be used to keep score in Scrabble, poker, card games, or anything that needs a numerical scorecard.
p2: Scrabble and Hearts were my favorite games to play while I was young (not that I'm old now), and it was near impossible to find a piece of paper and a pencil in my house to keep score with. I developed Score! to be an easy app to use to keep score in moments just like that. A simple interface makes it easy to add players, manipulate their scores, and reorder players by increasing and decreasing order. Score! is actually the first app that I developed seriously in Xcode, so it was a really important learning experience for me. It was developed in Swift 3 (later updated to Swift 4) and used tables, core data, and OOP. Later on, I added a save feature using core data, which allows users to exit the game and reload it once the app is closed. Score! also has the capability to share scores using Messenger.
