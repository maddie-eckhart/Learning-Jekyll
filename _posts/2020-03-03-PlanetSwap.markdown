description: I love Candy Crushâ€¦..probably to a fault. As of March, 2020 I am on level 2,761. I think it is the perfect game:colorful and engaging, with consistent new content. The game has new power ups and obstacles you unlock along your journey that make it intriguing, frustrating, and addicting. Candy Crush is a level-based, match-3 candy game and I have been playing it almost every day for the past 3 or 4 years. I love Candy Crush so much I decided to create my own.

p2: Planet Swap was inspired by my love of Candy Crush and my interest in SpriteKit, Apple's framework for mobile game development. I built the initial version of the game at Hack OHI/O, Ohio State's annual hackathon, and I really liked how it turned out. I followed a tutorial from raywenderlich.com to get me started and began making my own tweaks as the 24 hours came to a close. In version 1, when the app launched you would go straight into gameplay and through all 7 levels. Once you completed the last level, it looped you back around to the first level again. Literally endless fun.

p3: After a couple weeks, I decided to improve on the app, because I honestly did have a lot of fun creating, playing, and "researching" for it. I created new icons, a launch screen, and a lobby with an animated background for the first round. That is the version seen in the video above. In the near future, I want to add popups in between levels when gameplay begins and ends, a separate screen where you can pick a level to play once you unlock it, and add powerups for matches of 4 or more. This is my favorite side project I have worked on and I have high hopes for it.
